# Compiler
This is my submission for the compiler project extension. The following folders are relevant.

- stack-machine: contains my submission for the stack-machine project.
- lexer: contains my submissions for the lexer and AST projects.
- compiler: contains my submission for the compiler project.
- compiler-extension: contains my most up-to-date compiler, including all extensions.

Note that I used portions of the stack machine and lexer for my compiler, but the portions used can be found in the ocmpiler and compiler-extension folders.
