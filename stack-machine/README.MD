# Stack Machine
This project is part one of a semester-long project building a compiler. My goal is to build a stack machine.

# Usage
- Compile: g++ functions.cpp main.cpp -o sm
- To execute: ./sm.exe gcd.txt
- expected input: a file containing valid stack machine load, one line per line
- expected output: execution of the code, printed to the terminal as expected
- expected output: a file called debuglog.txt, containing certain traces for debugging

# AI Statement
For this assignment, I have utilized the **Github Copilot** extention in VSCode, a tool created by **Github**. This uses the **GPT-4o** model created by **OpenAI**. I have used this tool for the following purposes:
- Creating a template for functions.cpp, with each function to be filled in by myself
- Creating a placeholder for main.c, with most/all code to be rewritten by myself.
- Autocompleting certain lines of code, particularly in simple functions
